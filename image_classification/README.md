This directory contains two .ipynb files designed for the Deep Learning for AI course project.
The project goal is to develop a model which is able to accurately classifying a series of images into their correct classes. The model used is nearly identical 
in both the notebooks and it is employed across two distinct datasets:
- Intel Image Classification Dataset in *Landscape.ipynb*
- Plant Disease Recogntion Dataset in *Plant.ipynb*

Both the datasets are available at the adresses specified in the notebooks.
